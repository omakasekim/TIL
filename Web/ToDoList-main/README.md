# ToDoList

## Topic: Todo-List App for Students

As a high school student who is now going to college, I have learned that scheduling and making a to-do list, and accomplishing is crucial to finishing my work on time. However, planners and to-do list webpages/apps on market do not have every function I want and are uncomfortable to use. Therefore, I decided to design my own for myself and other students.

## The project is consisted of three pages

### P1 (Monthly Calendar Page)

You can choose the month with the button above and fill in the boxes showing the date with events or work to do on that day

### P2 (To-do List Page)

<img src="/dump/page2.png">
Show the day’s events on the top(what you have written on Calendar Page), and editable to-do list, and a monthly calendar that shows how many to do things you have planned for each day.

### P3 (Timer Page)

You can choose what background image to show up. There is also a timer that you could set a certain time limit, so you could use to study.
