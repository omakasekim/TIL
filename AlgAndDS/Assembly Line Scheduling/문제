In third line, the two integers x1, x2 are given.
In fourth line, the N integers a1,1, a1,2, … , a1,n are given (1 ≤ a1,j ≤ 100).
In fifth line, the N integers a2,1, a2,2, … , a2,n are given (1 ≤ a2,j ≤ 100).
In sixth line, the N integers t1,1, t1,2, … , t1,n-1 are given (1 ≤ t1,j ≤ 100).
In seventh line, the N integers t2,1, t2,2, … , t2,n-1 are given (1 ≤ t2,j ≤ 100).

Output (Standard output)

In first line, print the fastest assembly time.
In the next N line, print each process. Print with the output form given below:
