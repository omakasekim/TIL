Input (Standard input)


Each line of input consists of at most three integers.
If the first integer is 0, print the output and terminate the program.
If the first integer is 1, insert the second integer.
If the first integer is 2, extract the maximum number from the priority queue.
If the first integer is 3, substitute the third integer for the element indexed by the
second number. After the modification, the heap structure must be restored.
Assume that the smallest index of the priority queue is 1.
When the time parent node changes its value with one of child nodes value, if right
child value is same with left child value, parent node should change its value with right
child node.


Output (Standard output)
In the first line, print the extracted elements.
